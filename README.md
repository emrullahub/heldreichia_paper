# Heldreichia Paper

## Overview
This repository contains R scripts used in the study on Heldreichia species, focusing on SNP data analysis, population structure exploration, and gene enrichment. These scripts form the core analytical framework for the publication.

## Usage Instructions

1. **Prepare Input Data**
   Ensure VCF files are filtered and ready (e.g., `filtered_snps.vcf.gz`).
   Provide metadata files for populations and phenotypes (e.g., `sample.list`).

2. **Output**
   Outputs include heatmaps, PCA plots, bar plots, and structured data files for significant SNPs and enriched pathways.
